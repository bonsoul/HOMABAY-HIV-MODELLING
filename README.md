# HOMABAY-HIV-MODELLING

### 📊 Statistical Modeling of HIV Prevalence in Homa Bay County, Kenya

This project presents an analytical exploration of HIV prevalence in Homa Bay County using statistical modeling techniques in R. The goal is to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of HIV infections and assist in public health planning and resource allocation.

### 🧠 Project Overview
Homa Bay County has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in Kenya. This project leverages real-world data and applies advanced statistical methods to:

Model the number of people living with HIV across various sub-counties.

Estimate incidence and prevalence trends.

Evaluate the impact of demographic factors like age, sex, and region.

Visualize the spatial distribution and identify high-burden areas.

### 🔧 Tools and Libraries
R (statistical computing)

Tidyverse (data manipulation and visualization)

ggplot2 (data visualization)

sf and tmap (spatial data handling and mapping)

INLA (Bayesian spatial modeling)

dplyr, lubridate, readr, and more.

### 📌 Key Features
📍 Spatial Mapping: Geographical visualization of HIV prevalence across sub-counties.

🔍 Bayesian Modeling: Use of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to handle spatial correlation.

📈 Trend Analysis: Time series plots and comparison across demographic groups.

💡 Actionable Insights: Identification of high-risk regions and target populations for intervention.

### 📊 Visual Outputs
Sample visualizations include:

Choropleth maps of HIV prevalence by ward

Time-series plots of HIV prevalence and incidence

Model residual diagnostics and posterior distributions
